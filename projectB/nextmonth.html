      <p id="noteTitle">Welcome to MAY!</p>
      <p id="note">
        You are not enjoying it right?
        <br><br>
        The games might be interesting at first, but experiencing them over and over again makes it 
        boring. That is the same to our lockdown experience. 
        <br><br>
        Everyday, we are forced to deal with 
        the same kind of difficulties, food shortage, trying to finish our homework in great mental 
        stress, not able to meet the people we love, loosing one's job due to the close-down of company, 
        and so on. It is boring to play repeated games, but the relity is far 
        more severe then "boring". The senior students in NYUSH cannot have their commencement in person, and many even lose the chance to hug their friends and say "goodbye" in person. 
        There are more sad stories out there. Elders living alone passed away due to emergent situations, and their 
        familes can do nothing to help due to the lockdown. Even the elders living with their familes have passed 
        away for ambulance shortage, medical shortahe, and all kinds of pandemic restrictions. Companies and 
        self-employed merchants are in economic crisis. Many do not have enough income to return loans.
        <br><br>
        What is worse is that there is little we can do about it. I'm writing this paragraph on May 9th, and the lockdown 
        has not yet come to an end. No one knows when it might come to an end, and no one knows if everything
        can get back to "normal" when the lockdown ends. This is tragic. 
      
        <br><br>
        Although there is little we can do to change the situation, there is one thing we can do, that is do not 
        let it go when this is over. Let people know what is happening in Shanghai, and let ourselves remember what 
        we have been through this spring. Someone should is responsible for all these tragedies and chaos, 
        but definately not the people. The people of Shanghai are tenacious and brave to survive the past month.
        <br><br>
        Stay strong and give a big hug to the ones we love when this is over. Do reach out for help and take care. 
        <br><br>
        P.S. You are welcomed to share this project with anyone.
